# EdgeCase Ruby Koans
## rspec expect edition

_These koans are originally from http://www.rubykoans.com/.  This repo was forked from
[alycit/ruby_koans_rspec](https://github.com/alycit/ruby_koans_rspec), and then I converted
the tests to use `expect` instead of `should`, aligning with best practices per [betterspecs.org](http://www.betterspecs.org/)._

The Ruby Koans walk you along the path to enlightenment in order to learn Ruby.
The goal is to learn the Ruby language, syntax, structure, and some common
functions and libraries. We also teach you culture. Testing is not just something we
pay lip service to, but something we live.  It is essential in your quest to learn
and do great things in the language.

The koans are broken out into areas by file, hashes are covered in about_hashes.rb,
modules are introduced in about_modules.rb, etc. They are presented in order in the
`path_to_enlightenment.rb` file.

Each koan builds up your knowledge of Ruby and builds upon itself. It will stop at
the first place you need to correct.

Some koans simply need to have the correct answer substituted for an incorrect one.
Some, however, require you to supply your own answer. If you see the method `__`
(a double underscore) listed, it is a hint to you to supply your own code in order
to make it work correctly.
